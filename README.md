# shiny_embryo
Scripts for shiny app to visualize mammalian preimplantation embryo data in mouse, pig, cow, rabbit and rhesus. 


It will be possible to navigate our data online through embryo.helmholtz-munich.de. However in case the website is down, it is also possible to download the shiny here and run the shiny app locally through Rstudio. For this make sure to have Rstudio installed with the shiny package installes `library(shiny)`. You can run the app with `runApp(~/path_to_local_shiny_embryo_gitdir/)`. 

Please contact `marlies.oomen@helmholtz-munich.de` for any technical questions or `torres-padilla@helmholtz-muenchen.de` for any questions regarding our paper.

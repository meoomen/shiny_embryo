# shiny_embryo
Scripts for shiny app to visualize mammalian preimplantation embryo data in mouse, pig, cow, rabbit and rhesus. 

## Running our app locally
It will be possible to navigate our data online through embryo.helmholtz-munich.de. However in case the website is down, it is also possible to download the shiny app here and run the shiny app locally through Rstudio. 

For this make sure to have Rstudio installed with the shiny package installed and loaded `library(shiny)`. 
You can then run the app with `runApp(~/path_to_local_shiny_embryo_gitdir/)` or you can directly run `shiny::runGitHub(‘shiny_embryo’, ‘meoomen’)` without downloading the git repo first. 

Please contact `marlies.oomen@helmholtz-munich.de` for any technical questions or `torres-padilla@helmholtz-muenchen.de` for any questions regarding our paper.
